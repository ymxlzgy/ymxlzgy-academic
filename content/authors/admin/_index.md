I am a M.D. candidate supervised by Prof. Yong Liu at {{< staticref "https://april.zju.edu.cn/" "newtab" >}} APRIL Lab{{< /staticref >}}, {{< staticref "http://www.zju.edu.cn/" "newtab" >}} Zhejiang University{{< /staticref >}}. My research interest lies in robotics perception, including Geometry Learning and Multi-Object Tracking. I had also studied SLAM in earlier days. Before the master's study, I obtained my BEng at {{< staticref "https://www.nwpu.edu.cn" "newtab" >}} Northwestern Polytechnical University{{< /staticref >}}.
